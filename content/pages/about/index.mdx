Hi!

I am, Harsh Thakker, a Computer Scientist by training and a Consultant by profession. I currently work as an SME of Semantics and Graph technologies in the field of life sciences with OSTHUS GmbH in Aachen, Germany. I help organizations address complex data integration and data governance problems by leveraging the power of graph and semantic technology stacks.

Prior to OSTHUS, I worked as a Research Associate and a Marie-Curie Fellow at the Informatik III department of the University of Bonn, Germany.  My doctoral research was aligned with the EU-funded project WDAqua and BOOST4.0 projects. I worked at the intersection of Semantic Web and Graph Data Management Technologies for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs. I have also previously worked on Linked Open Data Quality Assessment. In particular, I like the theory and design of graph query languages (e.g. SPARQL, CYPHER, and Gremlin), benchmarking of Graph & RDF databases, and applied research in graph-driven Question Answering.

I love to do research and supervise students in my free time. I have published over 20 publications in the top conferences and Journals (ESWC, K-CAP, WWW, CLEF, AMW, SIGMOD-GRADES/NDA, ACCESS, etc) and won several best paper awards for my contributions to open-source Softwares and projects (see Research page). I also voluntarily contribute to an NGO "Zerotha Research" which has been founded with a mission to help students seeking guidance in research as their first step.
